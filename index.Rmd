### Unearthing insights {.tabset}

The study offers the first large-scale overview of well-dated human remains from northern European mires, with the principal goal to identify broad trends in frequency, location, and characteristics of finds. Researchers compiled a database consisting of 266 sites and more than 1,000 individuals. Using statistical modelling, they identified six major phases in history for this phenomenon. The main characteristics that distinguish each phase can be explored below.

#### Study Impact

This approach shows that widening the study's focus to encompass a larger study region, longer timeframe, the incorporation of bog mummies as well as bog skeletons, and the inclusion of both radiocarbon and historical dating evidence, permits new trends to come to light. The full database, freely available [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/bogs-bones-and-bodies-the-deposition-of-human-remains-in-northern-european-mires-9000-bcad-1900/B90A16A211894CB87906A7BCFC0B2FC7#supplementary-materials), offers great potential for the recognition of other trends and for further study.
